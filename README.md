## The Odin Project: Web Development 101
### **Project: HTML/CSS**

The first project in **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav)**. I chose to do the "hard version" - *Build the google.com search results page*.

## Thoughts
This one I found quite tedious in comparison with the previous exercises I had done. It took me a few days to write the HTML alone. What I did find, though, was that the previous exercises enabled me to structure my HTML so that it was 'ready' for CSS - i.e. putting things in containers, visualizing how flex-box was going to align the elements before I even added the CSS.
